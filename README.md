# 5-Day AI Agents Intensive Course with Google

## What is the 5-Day AI Agents Intensive?
This 5-day online course was crafted by Google's ML researchers and engineers to help developers explore the foundations and practical applications of AI agents. You'll learn the core components – models, tools, orchestration, memory and evaluation. Finally, you'll discover how agents move beyond LLM prototypes to become production-ready systems.

Each day blends conceptual deep dives with hands-on examples, codelabs, and live discussions. By the end, you'll be ready to build, evaluate, and deploy agents that solve real-world problems.

**Official Course:** https://www.kaggle.com/learn-guide/5-day-agents

## 🚀 Quick Start

Get started in 3 simple steps:

```bash
# 1. Run the setup script
./setup.sh

# 2. Add your Google API key to .env file
# Get your key from: https://aistudio.google.com/app/api-keys

# 3. Activate the virtual environment and run
source venv/bin/activate
cd Day-1
python day_1a_prompt_to_action.py
```

## 🔐 Security Note

Your API keys are stored in the `.env` file, which is protected by `.gitignore` and will **never** be committed to version control. Always keep your API keys private!

## 💡 Tips

- Always activate the virtual environment before running scripts: `source venv/bin/activate`
- Look for `(venv)` in your terminal prompt to confirm the environment is active
- Use `deactivate` when you're done working
- Each day's folder has its own detailed README with specific instructions

## 🤝 Contributing

Feel free to enhance these scripts or add your own examples! Just make sure to:
1. Never commit your `.env` file
2. Test your changes before committing
3. Update documentation as needed
